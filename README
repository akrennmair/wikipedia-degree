README for wikipedia-degree
===========================

Copy the wpdegree.cgi to your cgi-bin directory and make it executable.

Edit your wpdegree.cgi and set the path to your wikipedia-degree checkout
directory so that it is able to find the template. The checkout directory also
needs to be writable by the user under which wpdegree.cgi is executed.

Read the source code. Understand it. Before modifying it, be aware of the
security implications: code injection is possible even in LaTeX.
